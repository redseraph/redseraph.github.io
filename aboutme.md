The word *uncultivated* is a curious example of a term that can be applied equally to people and to agriculture, like *productive* or *growth*. Just as *productivity* is a trait to be encouraged in both character and agriculture, an *uncultivated* field is yet to be tilled and prepared for planting -- much like an uncultivated mind is yet to be refined by culture and education. 

But just as teenagers are wont to differ with their parents’ opinions on refining & educating the mind, humanity is by necessity seeing a shift in its approach to *cultivation*. The way that we have historically filled & subdued the earth, conforming nature to our needs, appears to be no longer sustainable, and different thinking is necessary that assigns a true value and importance to the *uncultivated* earth. 
 
Having lived in China and also through my time in the IT industry, I have witnessed not just the capacity for remarkable technological innovation but the speed at which good ideas can turn industries upside-down. But what is needed at this critical moment for our world, more so than high-tech silver bullets, is an approach that favours *uncultivation* – a recognition that natural biodiversity of ecosystems is essential for our well-being and survival - not a resource to be exploited but a wild playground to be treasured and nurtured for future generations.
